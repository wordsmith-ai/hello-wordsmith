                            HISTORICAL NOTE

                              ----------                              


    The Delegates who convened at the Federal Convention on May 
25, 1787, quickly rejected the idea of revising the Articles of 
Confederation and agreed to construct a new framework for a 
national government. Throughout the summer months at the 
Convention in Philadelphia, delegates from 12 States debated 
the proper form such a government should take, but few 
questioned the need to establish a more vigorous government to 
preside over the union of States. The 39 delegates who signed 
the Constitution on September 17, 1787, expected the new 
charter to provide a permanent guarantee of the political 
liberties achieved in the Revolution.
    Prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the 
Articles of Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress 
and approved by 13 States, provided for a union of the former 
British colonies. Even before Maryland became the last State to 
accede to the Articles in 1781, a number of Americans, 
particularly those involved in the prosecution of the 
Revolutionary War, recognized the inadequacies of the Articles 
as a national government. In the 1780s these nationally-minded 
Americans became increasingly disturbed by the Articles' 
failure to provide the central government with authority to 
raise revenue, regulate commerce, or enforce treaties.
    Despite repeated proposals that the Continental Congress 
revise the Articles, the movement for a new national government 
began outside the Congress. Representatives of Maryland and 
Virginia, meeting at Mt. Vernon to discuss trade problems 
between the two States, agreed to invite delegates from all 
States to discuss commercial affairs at a meeting in Annapolis, 
Maryland, in September 1786. Although delegates from only five 
States reached the Annapolis Convention, that group issued a 
call for a meeting of all States to discuss necessary revisions 
of the Articles of Confederation. Responding to this call and 
the endorsement of the Continental Congress, every State except 
Rhode Island selected delegates for the meeting in the State 
House at Philadelphia.
    The document printed here was the product of nearly four 
months of deliberations in the Federal Convention at 
Philadelphia. The challenging task before the delegates was to 
create a republican form of government that could encompass the 
13 States and accommodate the anticipated expansion to the 
West. The distribution of authority between legislative, 
executive, and judicial branches was a boldly original attempt 
to create an energetic central government at the same time that 
the sovereignty of the people was preserved.
    The longest debate of the Convention centered on the proper 
form of representation and election for the Congress. The 
division between small States that wished to perpetuate the 
equal representation of States in the Continental Congress and 
the large States that proposed representation proportional to 
population threatened to bring the Convention proceedings to a 
halt. Over several weeks the delegates developed a complicated 
compromise that provided for equal representation of the States 
in a Senate elected by State legislature and proportional 
representation in a popularly-elected House of Representatives.
    The conflict between large and small States disappeared in 
the early years of the republic. More lasting was the division 
between slave and free States that had been a disturbing 
undercurrent in the Convention debates. The Convention's 
strained attempt to avoid using the word slavery in the 
articles granting recognition and protection to that 
institution scarcely hid the regional divisions that would 
remain unresolved under the terms of union agreed to in 1787.
    The debates in the State ratification conventions of 1787 
and 1788 made clear the need to provide amendments to the basic 
framework drafted in Philadelphia. Beginning with 
Massachusetts, a number of State conventions ratified the 
Constitution with the request that a bill of rights be added to 
protect certain liberties at the core of English and American 
political traditions. The First Congress approved a set of 
amendments which became the Bill of Rights when ratified by the 
States in 1791. The continuing process of amendment, clearly 
described in the note of the following text, has enabled the 
Constitution to accommodate changing conditions in American 
society at the same time that the Founders' basic outline of 
national government remains intact.
                  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES\1\

                              ----------                              


We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect 
        Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide 
        for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure 
        the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do 
        ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of 
        America.

                               Article I.

    Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be 
vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist 
of a Senate and House of Representatives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   * * * * *                              
\1\This text of the Constitution follows the engrossed copy signed by 
Gen. Washington and the deputies from 12 States. The small superior 
figures preceding the paragraphs designate clauses, and were not in the 
original and have no reference to footnotes.

The Constitution was adopted by a convention of the States on September 
17, 1787, and was subsequently ratified by the several States, on the 
following dates: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 
1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; 
Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; 
Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, 
June 21, 1788.

Ratification was completed on June 21, 1788.

The Constitution was subsequently ratified by Virginia, June 25, 1788; 
New York, July 26, 1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Rhode 
Island, May 29, 1790; and Vermont, January 10, 1791.
                                   * * * * *                              
In May 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an 
alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but no action was taken on 
it, and it was left to the State Legislatures to proceed in the matter. 
In January 1786, the Legislature of Virginia passed a resolution 
providing for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three 
of them, should meet such commissioners as might be appointed in the 
other States of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to 
take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how 
far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary 
to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to 
the several States such an act, relative to this great object, as, when 
ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually 
to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some 
correspondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time, and 
the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other 
States were represented, viz: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and 
Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the 
circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present 
agreed upon a report (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York) expressing 
their unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance 
the interests of the Union if the States by which they were 
respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure 
the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of 
commissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday of May 
following, to take into consideration the situation of the United 
States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them 
necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate 
to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that 
purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to 
by them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, 
would effectually provide for the same.
                                   * * * * *                              
Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor 
of a convention, and the Legislatures of those States which had not 
already done so (with the exception of Rhode Island) promptly appointed 
delegates. On the 25th of May, seven States having convened, George 
Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the 
consideration of the proposed constitution was commenced. On the 17th 
of September, 1787, the Constitution as engrossed and agreed upon was 
signed by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, 
and Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the 
convention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating how 
the proposed Federal Government should be put in operation, and an 
explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed 
the Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning 
the same, to ``be transmitted to the several Legislatures in order to 
be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the 
people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.''

On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing 
the operations of Government under the new Constitution, it had been 
ratified by the conventions chosen in each State to consider it, as 
follows: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; 
New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, 
January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 
1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; 
Virginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.

The President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790, that 
North Carolina had ratified the Constitution November 21, 1789; and he 
informed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790, that Rhode Island had 
ratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, 
ratified the Constitution January 10, 1791, and was, by an act of 
Congress approved February 18, 1791, ``received and admitted into this 
Union as a new and entire member of the United States.''

    [Editorial note: There is some conflict as to the exact 
dates of ratification of the amendments by the several States. 
In some cases, the resolutions of ratification were signed by 
the officers of the legislatures on dates subsequent to that on 
which the second house had acted. In other cases, the Governors 
of several of the States ``approved'' the resolutions (on a 
subsequent date), although action by the Governor is not 
contemplated by article V, which required ratification by the 
legislatures (or conventions) only. In a number of cases, the 
journals of the State legislatures are not available. The dates 
set out in this document are based upon the best information 
available.]
   PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION NOT RATIFIED BY THE STATES

    During the course of our history, in addition to the 27 
amendments that have been ratified by the required three-
fourths of the States, six other amendments have been submitted 
to the States but have not been ratified by them.
    Beginning with the proposed Eighteenth Amendment, Congress 
has customarily included a provision requiring ratification 
within seven years from the time of the submission to the 
States. The Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 
(1939), declared that the question of the reasonableness of the 
time within which a sufficient number of States must act is a 
political question to be determined by the Congress.
    In 1789, twelve proposed articles of amendment were 
submitted to the States. Of these, Articles III-XII were 
ratified and became the first ten amendments to the 
Constitution, popularly known as the Bill of Rights. In 1992, 
proposed Article II was ratified and became the 27th amendment 
to the Constitution. Proposed Article I which was not ratified 
is as follows:

                          ``Article the first

    ``After the first enumeration required by the first article of the 
Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty 
thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the 
proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not 
less than one-hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative 
for every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives 
shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so 
regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred 
Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty 
thousand persons.''
                                ------                                

    Thereafter, in the 2d session of the Eleventh Congress, the 
Congress proposed the following article of amendment to the 
Constitution relating to acceptance by citizens of the United 
States of titles of nobility from any foreign government.
    The proposed amendment, which was not ratified by three-
fourths of the States, is as follows:

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, two thirds of both houses 
concurring, That the following section be submitted to the legislatures 
of the several states, which, when ratified by the legislatures of 
three fourths of the states, shall be valid and binding, as a part of 
the constitution of the United States.

    If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive or 
retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall, without the consent 
of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office or 
emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince or 
foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United 
States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit 
under them, or either of them.

    The following amendment to the Constitution relating to 
slavery was proposed by the 2d session of the Thirty-sixth 
Congress on March 2, 1861, when it passed the Senate, having 
previously passed the House on February 28, 1861. It is 
interesting to note in this connection that this is the only 
proposed (and not ratified) amendment to the Constitution to 
have been signed by the President. The President's signature is 
considered unnecessary because of the constitutional provision 
that on the concurrence of two-thirds of both Houses of 
Congress the proposal shall be submitted to the States for 
ratification.

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the following article be 
proposed to the Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by three-
fourths of said Legislatures, shall be valid, to all intents and 
purposes, as part of the said Constitution, viz:

                           ``Article Thirteen

    ``No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will 
authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within 
any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of 
persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.''
                                ------                                

    A child labor amendment was proposed by the 1st session of 
the Sixty-eighth Congress on June 2, 1926, when it passed the 
Senate, having previously passed the House on April 26, 1926. 
The proposed amendment, which has been ratified by 28 States, 
to date, is as follows:

  Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the 
                             United States

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House 
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an 
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when 
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, 
shall be valid to all intends and purposes as a part of the 
Constitution:

                              ``Article--.

    ``Section 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and 
prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.
    ``Section 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by this 
article except that the operation of State laws shall be suspended to 
the extent necessary to give effect to legislation enacted by the 
Congress.''
                                ------                                

    An amendment relative to equal rights for men and women was 
proposed by the 2d session of the Ninety-second Congress on 
March 22, 1972, when it passed the Senate, having previously 
passed the House on October 12, 1971. The seven-year deadline 
for ratification of the proposed amendment was extended to June 
30, 1982, by the 2d session of the Ninety-fifth Congress. The 
proposed amendment, which was not ratified by three-fourths of 
the States by June 30, 1982, is as follows:

  Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the 
        United States Relative to Equal Rights for Men and Women

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House 
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an 
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be 
valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when 
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States 
within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress:

                              ``Article--

    ``Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied 
or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.
    ``Sec. 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by 
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.
    ``Sec. 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date 
of ratification.''
                                ------                                

    An amendment relative to voting rights for the District of 
Columbia was proposed by the 2d session of the Ninety-fifth 
Congress on August 22, 1978, when it passed the Senate, having 
previously passed the House on March 2, 1978. The proposed 
amendment, which was not ratified by three-fourths of the 
States within the specified seven-year period, is as follows:

Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution to Provide 
    for Representation of the District of Columbia in the Congress.

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House 
concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an 
amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be 
valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when 
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States 
within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress:

                              ``Article--

    ``Section 1. For purposes of representation in the Congress, 
election of the President and Vice President, and article V of this 
Constitution, the District constituting the seat of government of the 
United States shall be treated as though it were a State.
    ``Sec. 2. The exercise of the rights and powers conferred under 
this article shall be by the people of the District constituting the 
seat of government, and as shall be provided by the Congress.
    ``Sec. 3. The twenty-third article of amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States is hereby repealed.
    ``Sec. 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it shall have 
been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures 
of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date 
of its submission.''
